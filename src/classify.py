"""
src/classify.py — Dual classifier: topic + stakes.

Responsibilities:
- Topic classification: assign one of {DPO, AML, Legal, Other}
- Stakes classification: assign one of {low, medium, high}

Both classifications are performed in a single Ollama (llama3.2) call using
the JSON-constrained output mode so the response is always parseable.

Topic definitions:
    DPO   — Data protection, privacy, GDPR/CCPA, PII handling, customer data,
             data retention periods, third-party data sharing, data subject rights,
             consent management, data breach notification
    AML   — Anti-money laundering, sanctions screening, transaction monitoring,
             SAR/CTR filing, KYC/CDD, financial crime, correspondent banking risk
    Legal — All other regulatory compliance: employment law, contract obligations,
             licensing, competition/antitrust, consumer protection, regulatory reporting
    Other — Does not fit DPO, AML, or Legal

Stakes definitions:
    low    — Informational query, no regulatory breach risk, no personal data involved
    medium — Moderate risk: could affect individuals or trigger a minor regulatory breach
    high   — Severe risk: potential regulatory breach, legal liability, involves
              sensitive personal data, large financial exposure, or criminal penalties

You are a compliance classification engine.

Given the query (and optional answer excerpt) below, respond with a JSON object
containing exactly two keys:
  "topic":  one of ["DPO", "AML", "Legal", "Other"]
  "stakes": one of ["low", "medium", "high"]

--- TOPIC DEFINITIONS ---
DPO   — Data protection, privacy, and personal information. Use DPO for:
          • GDPR / CCPA / data protection law questions
          • Personally identifiable information (PII) handling or storage
          • Customer data sharing with third parties or vendors
          • Data retention periods and deletion obligations
          • Data subject rights (access, erasure, portability, rectification)
          • Consent management and lawful basis for processing
          • Data breach identification, containment, and notification
          • Privacy impact assessments (DPIA / PIA)

AML   — Anti-money laundering, financial crime, and sanctions. Use AML for:
          • Suspicious activity reports (SAR) and currency transaction reports (CTR)
          • Transaction monitoring, screening, and red-flag analysis
          • Sanctions lists (OFAC, EU, UN) and politically exposed persons (PEP)
          • Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD / EDD)
          • Money laundering, terrorist financing, or fraud typologies
          • Correspondent banking risk and de-risking
          • Beneficial ownership and ultimate beneficial owner (UBO) rules

Legal — All other regulatory and legal compliance not covered by DPO or AML:
          • Employment law, workplace obligations, disciplinary procedures,
            redundancy, notice periods, working time rules, discrimination
          • Contract interpretation, obligations, and breach
          • Licensing, regulatory registration, and authorisation requirements
          • Competition / antitrust rules and market abuse
          • Consumer protection and fair dealing obligations
          • General corporate governance and regulatory reporting
          • Health & safety obligations

Other — Use ONLY if the query is not a compliance or regulatory question at all
        (e.g. "how do I reset my VPN password", purely operational logistics).

--- STAKES DEFINITIONS ---
low    — Informational; no regulatory breach risk; no sensitive personal data
medium — Moderate risk; could affect individuals or trigger a minor regulatory breach
high   — Severe risk; potential regulatory breach, legal liability, criminal
         penalties, sensitive personal data, or large financial exposure

--- FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ---
Example 1
Query: What is the maximum retention period for customer KYC records?
Answer excerpt: (none)
Output: {{"topic": "AML", "stakes": "low"}}

Example 2
Query: Can we share customer PII with our third-party marketing vendor without
       explicit consent?
Answer excerpt: (none)
Output: {{"topic": "DPO", "stakes": "high"}}

Example 3
Query: Do we need to file a SAR for this transaction where a customer deposited
       $12,000 in cash across two branches on the same day?
Answer excerpt: Structuring transactions to avoid CTR thresholds is a red flag.
Output: {{"topic": "AML", "stakes": "high"}}

Example 4
Query: What notice period are we required to give employees before redundancy?
Answer excerpt: (none)
Output: {{"topic": "Legal", "stakes": "medium"}}

Example 5
Query: Can we dismiss an employee who has been on sick leave for six months?
Answer excerpt: (none)
Output: {{"topic": "Legal", "stakes": "high"}}

Example 6
Query: Do we need a DPIA before launching this new customer analytics feature?
Answer excerpt: (none)
Output: {{"topic": "DPO", "stakes": "low"}}

--- BEFORE YOU ANSWER, CHECK ---
- Mentions PII, personal data, GDPR, CCPA, DPIA, data subject rights, retention,
  consent, data breach, or third-party data sharing? -> topic = "DPO"
- Mentions sanctions, SAR, CTR, AML, KYC, transaction screening, money laundering,
  structuring, or terrorist financing? -> topic = "AML"
- Mentions employment, redundancy, dismissal, notice period, discipline,
  discrimination, licensing, contracts, regulatory reporting, or health & safety?
  -> topic = "Legal"
- Use topic = "Other" ONLY for non-compliance questions (e.g. IT passwords,
  canteen menus). If the query is about any law, regulation, or compliance
  obligation, it MUST be DPO, AML, or Legal — never Other.

Example of Other (non-compliance):
Query: How do I reset my VPN password?
Output: {{"topic": "Other", "stakes": "low"}}

--- INPUT ---
Query: {query}
Answer excerpt (may be empty): {answer_excerpt}

Respond with ONLY the JSON object. No explanation, no markdown, no extra keys.
